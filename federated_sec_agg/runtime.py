    """Cross-task mutual exclusion around BaseModelCache's shared PeftModel.

    Flower's simulation backend can dispatch multiple sampled clients' fit() calls with overlapping execution, even with client-resources
    num_gpus=1.0 requesting the whole GPU per activation 
    
    With 5 clients, most fit() calls raced and hit Opacus's "Trying to add hooks twice to the same model" -- num_gpus governs Ray's
    scheduling weight, not a hard mutual-exclusion lock on client task execution. 
    A plain in-process threading.Lock was tried first and did NOT reliably prevent this -- it's unclear whether Ray's task dispatch
    for this backend genuinely uses separate OS threads, separate (sub)processes sharing a reported pid, or something else, so an
    in-memory Python lock's shared-object assumption can't be trusted. 

    An OS-level flock() works, since the kernel enforces it independent of any Python object identity.

    The remaining suspect is concurrency inside a single Ray actor's own task execution (e.g. how ClientAppActor.run is
    invoked/awaited as a remote call, or something in Ray's own async task scheduling for a single actor) -- this needs checking against
    Ray's source, not flwr's, since flwr only submits the task and blocks on the future (RayBackend.process_message).
